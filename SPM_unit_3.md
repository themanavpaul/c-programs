## Black-Box Testing

### Definition
Black-box testing is a software testing technique that focuses on the functionality of the software system without any knowledge of its internal workings. In black-box testing, the tester only has access to the inputs and outputs of the system being tested.

### Steps
The following are the steps involved in performing black-box testing:

1. Test Planning: The first step in black-box testing is to plan the tests. This involves identifying the requirements of the system being tested and determining what test cases will be used.

2. Test Case Design: The next step is to design test cases based on the requirements of the system being tested. This involves identifying input values that will be used to test different aspects of the system.

3. Test Execution: Once test cases have been designed, they can be executed against the system being tested. This involves running each test case and recording its results.

4. Test Reporting: Finally, test results can be reported. This includes documenting any defects found during testing and providing recommendations for improving the system.

### Technique
The following are some techniques used in black-box testing:

- Equivalence Class Partitioning: This technique involves dividing input values into groups or classes that are expected to behave similarly.
- Boundary Value Analysis: This technique involves selecting input values that are at or near boundaries between different equivalence classes.
- Decision Table Testing: This technique involves creating a table that lists all possible combinations of inputs and their expected outputs.
- State Transition Testing: This technique is used for systems that have different states or modes of operation. It involves designing tests that transition between different states.

Now, here's a table comparing Equivalence Class Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, and Cause-Effect Graph:

| Technique | Definition | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Equivalence Class Partitioning | Divides input values into groups or classes that are expected to behave similarly. | Reduces the number of test cases needed. | May not identify all defects. |
| Boundary Value Analysis | Selects input values that are at or near boundaries between different equivalence classes. | Can identify defects related to boundary conditions. | May not identify all defects. |
| Cause-Effect Graph | Identifies the relationship between inputs

and outputs of a system using a graphical representation. | Can identify complex relationships between inputs and outputs. | May be difficult to create and maintain the graph. |

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
