| Criteria | Waterfall Model | Prototyping Model | Spiral Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Definition | A linear sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. | An iterative approach to software development where a working prototype is developed and refined through multiple iterations. | An iterative approach to software development that emphasizes risk analysis and mitigation throughout the process. |
| Phases | Requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance. | Requirements gathering, prototype design and development, prototype testing and refinement. May include additional phases for final implementation and testing. | Objective setting, risk analysis and mitigation planning, prototyping and testing, evaluation and feedback. May include additional phases for final implementation and testing. |
| Working | Each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. Changes made in later phases can be difficult or costly to implement. | A working prototype is developed quickly using a subset of requirements. The prototype is then refined through multiple iterations until it meets all requirements. Changes can be made easily at any stage of development. | Risk analysis is performed at each stage of development to identify potential issues early on. Prototypes are developed iteratively with feedback from stakeholders throughout the process. |
| Advantages | Clear structure makes it easy to plan and manage projects with well-defined requirements. Each phase provides a clear deliverable that can be reviewed by stakeholders before moving on to the next phase.| Rapid prototyping allows for quick feedback from stakeholders and early identification of issues or changes needed in requirements.| Risk analysis helps identify potential issues early on in the process which can save time and money in the long run by avoiding costly rework later on in development process|
| Disadvantages 	| Changes made late in the process can be difficult or costly to implement. May not be suitable for projects with changing requirements or where stakeholder feedback is important. | May not be suitable for large or complex projects. Can lead to scope creep if stakeholders become too focused on the prototype rather than the final product. | Can be time-consuming and costly due to the emphasis on risk analysis and prototyping. May not be suitable for small or simple projects. |
| Applicability | Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change significantly during development process.| Suitable for projects where stakeholder feedback is important and requirements may change frequently during development process.| Suitable for large or complex projects where risk analysis is important and where requirements may change frequently during development process. Also suitable for projects where early identification of potential issues is important. |
| Examples | Developing a new operating system, building a bridge, creating a new software application with well-defined requirements. | Developing a new user interface for an existing software application, creating a new website or mobile app with changing requirements based on user feedback. | Developing a new medical device, creating a new financial system with complex requirements and potential risks that need to be identified and mitigated early on in the process. |
